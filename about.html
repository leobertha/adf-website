The ADF helps students pursue their dreams of achieving a college education and developing marketable skills so that they may contribute as valuable members of their communities—an opportunity that Amadou was denied. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-1-6">Over the last two decades, the ADF has identified and supported 27 students of African descent in the United States through our memorial scholarships. The ADF hosts community events that bring activists, academics, and policy makers together to raise awareness about topics like democracy, police brutality and white supremacy. Across the Atlantic, in West Africa, the ADF continues to run the ADF Computer Center in Conakry, Guinea, where students learn how to code and leverage digital technology to build careers deserving of their God-given talents and newfound skills.</p>
                                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3k text-primary">Our Future</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-1-6">Moving into 2022 and beyond, the ADF will continue to meet the growing needs of our current and prospective scholars. New initiatives like our leadership training program and our global mentorship network will bridge the divide between young people in Africa and those in the African Diaspora as they strive to transform this world for the betterment of all. We want them to succeed—and we hope that you do, too.  </p>

                </div>
                    <p class="text-center">I was thrilled to hear the excitement in my son’s voice when he called me January 31, 1999 from New York City. “I’m so happy right now, Mom! I am going to do it.” “Do what?” I asked from my home in Guinea.  “Enroll in College,” he enthusiastically replied.</p>
                        <br /><p class="text-center text-primary font-weight-600">I asked him if he needed my help, and he said, “No, I only need your prayers.”</p><br />
                    <p class="text-center">That was the last phone call I had with my son. Four days later, February 4th, 1999, my world as I knew it was forever changed, and so was my role as a mother. I was thrust into a new role, one that I could have never imagined, but am fully committed to – ensuring the legacy of my son and speaking out against the injustices that resulted in his death.</p>
                    <p class="mb-1-9 text-center">The Amadou Diallo Foundation Scholarship Program was established in honor of Amadou’s academic dreams. In the spirit of Amadou, the foundation has, thus far, proudly given away scholarships to students of African descent who are achieving their college degrees. Amadou will always have my prayers, as he requested. And part of that prayer now is to support other eager students in realizing their academic dreams. While Amadou’s dreams may never be realized, through this scholarship program, and with your generous support, others will be.</p>

                                 <p class="mt-2 fw-bold">Dear Friend,</p>

                                 <p>I have been arrested twice in my life – once in 1984 and once in 1999.</p>

                                 <p>Not as a rebellious teenager or a 20-something street hustler. Not because I was a thief or a murderer. The first time I was protesting Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment. The second time the wrongful killing of a 23-year-old man in New York City.</p>

                                 <p>It has been 15 years since February 4th, 1999 when the world’s spotlight was on 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx where the NYPD shot an innocent, unarmed Amadou Diallo 41 times in the vestibule of his apartment building. Fifty-four days later, outside of Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan, I was charged with disorderly conduct for protesting that inconceivable crime. I wasn’t alone. Rallies and protests were frequent and ongoing. Prayer vigils were held and candles were lit. Other politicians, celebrities and public figures came out in droves contributing their voices to the community’s, which was one of outrage and disbelief. The community’s love rallied around a mother, and a mother’s love rallied around the legacy of her child.</p>

                                 <p>When Kadiatou asked me to Chair the foundation formed in her son’s name, I was honored.</p>

                                 <p>The Foundation’s mission embraces Amadou’s humanitarian spirit and the academic dreams he held for his life, while also remaining committed to finding proactive, collaborative solutions to remedy and eradicate the social and systemic issues that resulted in his death. It is with great enthusiasm that I write this note to you introducing The Amadou Diallo Foundation’s vision for 2014.</p>

                                 <p>It is our vision to host and facilitate a necessary, national dialogue on race and police community relations via panel discussions, workshops, seminars and other educational events. By calling on all stakeholders in our society – policy makers, law enforcement, community activists, parents, youth, Academia – I firmly believe with conscious, compassionate conversation and effective communication, we can find common ground and enact change.  I will keep you abreast of these events as they happen. Bruce Springsteen wrote the song “American Skin” after Amadou Diallo’s death in 1999. He rededicated the song to Trayvon Martin after his in 2012.  Let’s not have that song dedicated to anyone else.</p>

                                 <p><b>Now, more than ever, with the devastatingly drastic number of police shootings and other racially motivated crimes capturing news headlines, The Amadou Diallo Foundation is needed. Now, more than ever, with the cost of college tuition often a daunting deterrent to pursuing higher education, The Amadou Diallo Foundation is needed.</b></p>

                                 <p>I see that need as a call to action, which is why now, more than ever, the Board of Directors and I are asking for you to join us.</p>

                                            <p>Kadiatou Diallo is the Founder of the Amadou Diallo Foundation, author, social activist & public speaker. But first and foremost, she is a mother. It was her role as mother that captivated the heart of
                                            America and thrust her into the social justice spotlight when her 23-year-old son Amadou Diallo
                                            s student was shot 41 times by four New York City Police officers while standing in the vestibule
                                            of his Bronx apartment building, February 4th, 1999.</p>

                                            <p>The city erupted with protests and prayer vigils as politicians, celebrities and community
                                            members spoke out with disbelief and a demand for justice as both the national and
                                            international media focused on what happened that winter evening at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in
                                            the Bronx.</p>

                                            <p>The community stood up for a grieving mother and a grieving mother showed up fiercely,
                                            graceful and inspirationally compelling in her quest for justice.</p>

                                            <p>Mrs. Diallo rejects the portrayal of her son in the media and has become a symbol of the
                                            struggle against police brutality and racial profiling in the United States, and is using her
                                            experience to empower others. She founded The Amadou Diallo Foundation, which mission is
                                            to advocate for racial equity and promote education for students of African descent.
                                            Mrs. Diallo humanizes the tragedy of racial profiling and police brutality and continues to
                                            aggressively work with community leaders to bring about change. She has worked closely with
                                            families affected by police brutality and grassroots organizations to raise awareness and
                                            dedicated her life to ending racial inequities.</p>

                                            <p>As a member of the Justice Committee (JC), Kadiatou Diallo unites with other families who have
                                            lost loved ones to the NYPD to help lead NYC's movement for an end to police violence. Over
                                            the past decade, the families in JC have provided leadership for numerous victorious
                                            Communities United for Police Reform systemic campaigns, including winning a Special
                                            Prosecutor Executive Order in 2015 and passage of legislation to repeal the "Police Secrecy
                                            Law" (50s) and codify a special prosecutor for all police killings in 2020.</p>
